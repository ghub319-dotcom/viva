# Readify — Frontend Prototype

A multi-page, HTML/CSS/JS-only front-end for Readify, an interactive reading platform.

Pages:

	- `js/*.extra.js` — Page-specific extras providing small UI enhancements (home, explorer, progress, recommender, flow, feedback)
		- Recommender improvements: "View in Explorer" button to open the selected book in the Book Explorer; save button is disabled unless a selection is active and gives user feedback.  
		 - Reading Flow: added multi-sound options (Cozy Lounge, Rain, Cafe Ambience), play/pause button, and volume control; settings are persisted in localStorage across sessions.
How to run:
- Open `index.html` in a browser. No server required.
 - Open `index.html` in a browser. No server required. For local images to load from `assets/`, open the file directly (modern browsers allow file:// requests for local assets).
 - In the Feedback page, there is a Google Maps embed showing a sample location and an 'Open in Google Maps' link for navigation. The map is embedded via an iframe and centers on New York by default; update the query in `feedback.html` if you'd like a different location.
 - Open `index.html` in a browser. No server required. For local images to load from `assets/`, open the file directly (modern browsers allow file:// requests for local assets).
Tools used: LocalStorage for persistence, best-effort accessible interactions, responsive CSS and JS.

Notes: Images are inline placeholders (SVG/CSS). You can replace with your assets in `assets/` if needed.
